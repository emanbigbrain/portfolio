        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="aboutText">My name is Emmanuel Lutterodt, and I come from the capital city of Germany, Berlin. I have traveled and lived in multiple countries gathering experiences only few can understand. Currently residing in Sweden, I study Business and Management at Stockholm School of Economics, and hold a background in New Media Design.</br></br>Having been awarded global accolades such as Gold and Silver in their respective categories in Branding by the 7th edition of the Indigo Design Award, I am burning of enthusiasm and motivation to become a pivotal figure within Branding.<br><br>I believe that in order to become familiar with a brand, and to convey proper messaging through various channels we need to be both experts of Business and Branding. Setting a distinguishable line between both is important, however, finding a way for both business management and branding to seamlessly integrate with one another to reflect their core values and personality is what makes the biggest brands successful.<br><br>I hope you take a look around my work which I am more thank grateful for, having worked with an award winning agency, freelance, and self-initiated projects.<br><br>If it interests you, I am a real volleyball fan! So contact me if youâ€™d like to talk about volleyball ;D.  </p>
